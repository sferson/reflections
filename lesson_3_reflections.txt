	When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're working collaboratively with others, when you work from more than one machine, as an off-site backup.

	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Your remote work could get corrupted by changes someone else has made?
