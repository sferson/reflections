	When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're working collaboratively with others, when you work from more than one machine, as an off-site backup.

	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Your remote work could get corrupted by changes someone else has made?

	Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clone is when you take a copy of an existing repository.  Forking is essentially doing the same on GitHub but GitHub does some tracking of forking activity.  Branches just allow for creating alternative versions in the same repository - presumably for use when you'll eventually want to merge the code-lines back in.
