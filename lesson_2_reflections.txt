	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The metadata folder is created and "initialised" - whatever that means.  You presumably need to have placeholders for the metadata before you start committing things!


	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains only files that are going to be committed next, whereas the working directory and the repository both contain all the files.
